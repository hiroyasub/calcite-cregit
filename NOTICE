This product includes software from the Eigenbase project, licensed from
DynamoBI Corporation. DynamoBI describes the progeny of the IP:

   The code in this repository is provided 100% unencumbered via the ASL 2.0
   from DynamoBI Corporation.  This code is based on the work of numerous
   companies and individuals through the collaboration and Copyright/IP sharing
   framework that existed at Eigenbase Foundation (a non profit).

   Eigenbase released the entire codebase directly to the public under the terms
   of the GPLv2 but also had separate, full copyright sharing agreements with
   companies deeply involved at Eigenbase (SQLstream, LucidEra, DynamoBI)

   In short, all companies had joint copyright on each others Eigenbase code and
   could license as they see fit, without accounting to the other (including
   commercial closed source licensing).  The IP was NOT shared (meaning each
   owns a portion) but rather joint (each owns it all, without account to
   other).

   All IP in this repository is provided to the public, at large, under the
   terms of the ASL 2.0 by either:

   a) The copyrights/IP DynamoBI has obtained from it's contractual / legal
   agreement with Eigenbase (JDA) and the corresponding agreements between other
   individuals/companies and Eigebnase (JCAs/JDAs)

   -or-

   b) Direct ASL licensing / CLAs (any code commits after ASL relicense early
   2012)

   Eigenbase JDAs, and JCAs or Apache CLAS cover 100% of the project code
   provided in this repository are available here:
